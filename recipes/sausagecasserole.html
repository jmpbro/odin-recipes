    <p>Sausage casserole is a hearty, comforting dish that's beloved in many households for its simplicity, rich flavor, and versatility. Often served as a one-pot meal, it combines juicy sausages with a medley of vegetables, aromatic herbs, and a savory sauce to create something that’s both satisfying and full of warmth. Whether you’re cooking for a family dinner, a casual get-together, or looking for a weeknight meal that stretches across a couple of days, sausage casserole is a go-to option that never disappoints.</p>
    <p>At its core, the dish begins with quality sausages—these can be pork, beef, chicken, or even plant-based alternatives. Traditional pork sausages tend to be the most common, offering a rich, meaty flavor that stands up well to slow cooking. The sausages are typically browned first to seal in flavor and add texture. This step also leaves behind delicious browned bits in the pan, which help deepen the taste of the overall casserole when deglazed with liquid.</p>
    <p>Vegetables like onions, carrots, and bell peppers often form the base of the casserole, sautéed until soft and fragrant. Garlic, thyme, rosemary, and bay leaves are common additions that infuse the dish with depth. Some versions include mushrooms, celery, or even leafy greens for added nutrition and complexity. Many recipes also feature beans—such as cannellini, butter, or kidney beans—which make the dish even more filling and provide a pleasant contrast to the sausages.</p>
    <p>Ingredients</p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>6 pork sausages (or your preferred type: beef, chicken, or plant-based)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely sliced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>       
        <li>2 carrots, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, chopped</li>         
        <li>1 yellow bell pepper, chopped</li>         
        <li>400g (14 oz) canned chopped tomatoes</li>         
        <li>1 tablespoon tomato purée</li>         
        <li>400g (14 oz) canned cannellini beans, drained and rinsed</li>
        <li>250ml (1 cup) chicken or vegetable stock</li>    
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Method</p>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>Brown the sausages
        Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large casserole dish or deep frying pan over medium heat.
        Add the sausages and cook for 6–8 minutes, turning regularly, until they are nicely browned all over.
        Remove the sausages from the pan and set them aside.</li>
          
        <li>Sauté the vegetables
        In the same pan, add the sliced onion and carrots. Cook for 5 minutes until they start to soften.
        Add the chopped bell peppers and continue to cook for another 3–4 minutes.
        Stir in the minced garlic and cook for 1 more minute.</li>
        
        <li>Add seasoning and tomato base
        Sprinkle in the smoked paprika and thyme, stirring to coat the vegetables.
        Add the tomato purée and cook for 1 minute to bring out its flavor.
        Pour in the chopped tomatoes and stir well.</li>
          
        <li>Deglaze (optional)
        If using red wine or cider, pour it in now to deglaze the pan, scraping up any browned bits stuck to the bottom. Let it bubble for 1–2 minutes.</li>
          
        <li>Add beans and stock
        Add the drained cannellini beans and pour in the stock.
        Stir everything together, then return the sausages to the pan.
        Tuck in the bay leaf and season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
          
        <li>Simmer
        Bring the casserole to a gentle boil, then reduce the heat to low.
        Cover with a lid and simmer for 25–30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sausages are fully cooked and the sauce has thickened slightly.</li>
          
        <li>Serve
        Remove the bay leaf before serving.
        Optionally, sprinkle with chopped fresh parsley for a burst of color and freshness.
        Serve hot with mashed potatoes, rice, or crusty bread.</li>
      </ol>
